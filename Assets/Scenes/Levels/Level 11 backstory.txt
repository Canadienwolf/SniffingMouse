One day , our friend the gentle mouse was so hungry and he hasn't got anything to eat outside,
then he met his friend garry. Garry told him that there's a house at the end of the street
that he has been in last week which has a really delicious types of cheese to enjoy,
and he promised him if he eat all the cheese there he will be full.
The house is always empty in the afternoon as the owners and their kids are at work/school,
But he adviced him to be careful because there're many traps inside the house that can catch/kill him
while exploring the house.Now our friend is inside the house , so let's explore it and get as much as
possible cheese that we can !
